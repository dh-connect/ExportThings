# ExportThings - for exporting Things database to the Desktop as Things Backup.txt

# Copyright (c) 2012, Dexter Ang
#
# Somewhat based on "Export Things to text file (ver 1)" by John Wittig
# and from reading the Things AppleScript Guide (rev 13).
#
# Tested with Things 2.0.1 and OS X Mountain Lion
#
# TODO:
# - Get Repeating ToDos (currently no way via AppleScript).
# - Make tags tab delimited by heirarchy.
# - Export Areas. Maybe.
# - For each exported ToDo, also include their tags and areas. Maybe.
